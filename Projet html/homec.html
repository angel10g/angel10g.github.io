    <h2>Debut Of Our Hotel </h2>
    <p>
      Cape Town (Kaapstad in Afrikaans and Ikapa in Xhosa), is a modern city with a fascinating history.
      It was the establishment of the Dutch East 
      India Company by Jan van Riebeeck in 1652 that eventually 
      led to the arrival of slaves to support labour needs in the 
      growing settlement. For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, 
      the Netherlands and Britain fought for control of South Africa,
       with Britain ultimately prevailing to form the multicultural 
       Union of South Africa (later the Republic of South Africa) in 1910, 
       with Cape Town as its capital.nd in one of the most famous moments marking
        the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech 
        from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall just hours after being released from prison. <br>
       Today, with 11 official languages, Cape Town proudly 
       embraces its multicultural diversity with everything from 
       cutting-edge street art to world-class cuisine, and from the 
       brightly coloured facades of the Bo-Kaap to the Afro-chic décor 
       of trendy cafés and bars.
